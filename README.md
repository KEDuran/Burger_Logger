* Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

* Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Devour it!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.

* Your app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
